Welcome to my book finder application.

This App was built with CSS, JavaScript, and React.js as the library.

The app allows users to search for books by title, author, keyword, or ISBN. 
It provides a simple interface for book lovers to explore a new world by discovering new reads, learning about their favorite authors, and exploring a vast collection of books from various genres.

When users type an author's name, a book title, an ISBN, or a keyword, the search returns all books that fit the input value, in addition to details about each of the books.

At the moment, the only route is from the "enter" button. 
I would have preferred that after clicking the "enter" button, I would be routed to a "books results" page that had blocks of all the results, and when each book is clicked, I would be routed to that book's dedicated page; however, I struggled to get this route to work, and once it did, I decided to stop.
if I had more time to make mistakes and learn from my mistakes, I would have done better.


Successes:
 The "enter" button routes to a books results page for users to choose from.

 Improvments:
 -Clicking the back button from the books search results page does not clear the data from the previous search.
 -If a new search is to be done, the cover page must be refreshed first, otherwise the search will return results from a previous search.

Technologies Used:

React.js:I used React JS to build the different components-homepage, bookspage, mainpage.

API Integration: I used google books APIs to fetch books and their details, and to ensure that information returned is up to date.

CSS: I used CSS styles to add a simple style to the user interface.
